I am a passionate software engineer with over 6 years of experience building scalable backend systems and optimizing performance for high-traffic applications. My expertise spans Python, Go, Java, C++, and JavaScript, and I have a strong track record of developing microservices, payment gateways, and eCommerce platforms that have driven significant revenue growth and efficiency improvements.

Beyond my professional work, I have undertaken diverse projects showcasing my skills in areas like blockchain, cybersecurity, distributed systems, and database implementation. I thrive on solving complex problems and am constantly expanding my knowledge, as evidenced by my completion of advanced courses from institutions like Georgia Tech and MIT.

As a lifelong learner and active contributor to the developer community, I am always eager to take on new challenges and share my knowledge with others. If you're looking for a dedicated and versatile software engineer with a blend of backend development, cybersecurity, and distributed systems skills, I would love to connect and discuss how I can contribute to your projects.
