2016-07-04	Securing Data Planes in Software-Defined-Networks	IEEE NetSoft SecVirtNet Workshop	This paper explores practical solutions for localizing and mitigating malicious switches that disobey installed flow rules. Our main insight is that the flexible and proactive nature of SDNs enables efficient defense against realistic adversaries who can collude and report falsified information in addition to manipulating packet forwarding decisions.
